He's Warren Buffett, and many consider him to be the greatest investor that's ever lived. As of June 2018, according to Forbes, the 87-year-old is the 3rd richest person in the world (worth $82B, despite the fact that he's donated nearly $32B to charity). Only Jeff Bezos of Amazon ($112B) and Bill Gates of Microsoft ($90B) are worth more than he is.

The interesting thing about Buffett is that he didn't become a billionaire until he was 56, an old man compared to Gates, who was 31 when he joined the Three Comma Club, and Bezos, who was 35. If it took him so long to earn his first billion, how did he make the rest so quickly?

And it's easy to see how Gates and Bezos earned their remaining billions: after Bill's first in 1987 and Jeff's first in 1999, Microsoft and Amazon just got bigger and bigger, taking their founders' wallets along for the ride. But Buffett didn't invent an online everything store or software that runs on nearly every computer on the planet. He didn't invent anything, actually - so how did he get so rich?

The answer to both of these questions is compound interest.

### Investing And Compound Interest: A Bitcoin Example

While Gates and Bezos both created awe-inspiring companies that repeatedly churn out world-changing products, Buffett has made his fortune through investing, which is basically putting your money somewhere and hoping it grows.

To understand investing and the almost magical powers of compound interest, let's take a look at an example from recent memory: Bitcoin. On January 1, 2017, a single Bitcoin was worth about $1K, but, by January 1, 2018, that same Bitcoin was worth more than $13K!

Now let's consider two investors: Alice and Bob. On January 1, 2017, they were both convinced that Bitcoin was an amazing investment, and as a consequence they both wanted to put as much money as possible into Bitcoin. Alice had been making money from successful investing for quite some time, so she was able to purchase $1B of Bitcoin. Bob, however, was just starting his investing career, so he was only able to purchase $1 of Bitcoin.

After a year, Bob's $1 investment was worth $13, enough to buy a large pizza from Domino's. Alice's investment, though, was now worth a whopping $13B, enough to buy the entire Domino's pizza company!

So let's take a look at what happened here: both Alice and Bob had the same amazing idea of buying Bitcoin, but Alice was able to make $12B in profit from the idea, while Bob was only able to make $12. Alice didn't make that much more than Bob because she's a better investor - they both had the same idea. Alice made that much more than Bob because she had already been a successful investor for some time, and as a consquence had more money to invest!

That's basically how compound interest works: If you have a lot of money to invest, then your opportunity to make more money from new investments is that much larger.

With this in mind, it becomes easy to see how Buffett was able to make so much money so late in his life: When he was 14, he only had $5K, so any amazing investment idea would only make him a few thousand dollars. By the time he was 30, he had $1M to invest, so an amazing investment idea could make him a few million dollars. And when he became a billionaire at 56, he entered Alice territory, where an amazing investment idea could make him billions of dollars! Buffett, being the amazing investor that he is, has been producing amazing investment ideas all his life, and that has allowed him to grow his net worth to the stratosphere.

### Why You Should Start Investing ASAP

Buffett started his investing career at the young age of 14, when he had just $5K. Let's call him Fast Warren, and let's compare his fortunes to those of Slow Warren, who waited until he was 34 to start investing those first $5K.

As we saw earlier, the magic of compound interest is that the more money you have to invest, the larger your opportunity to make more money. While Fast Warren had more than $3M to invest at age 34, Slow Warren was just getting started, and his opportunities were constrained by his relatively small net worth of $5K.

Slow Warren, despite having gotten a late start, was still the legendary Warren Buffett, so in just 16 years, he was able to turn his initial $5K into his first $1M. He's now 50 years old, and the magic of compound interest makes it such that his profit opportunities are much larger than when he got started. Fast Warren, however, is doing better still - by the time he was 50, his net worth had grown to about $100M, making his profit generating potential about 100 times that of Slow Warren.

The same thing happens when Slow Warren finally makes his first $1B at the age of 76. Sure, he's doing really well compared to most of us, but he's nowhere near the top of the Forbes list. By this age, Fast Warren was worth tens of billions, which set the stage for him to reach his current gargantuan net worth over the last 11 years.

While the average investor may not be as skilled as Warren Buffett, he/she still has much to gain from starting to invest ASAP. Check out this table that shows how $10K grows over time at different rates of return (the better you are at investing, the higher rate of return you'll be able to obtain):

For example, suppose you're a 20-year-old with $10K to invest, and that you plan to invest until you retire at age 70. If you start investing now, and you obtain a historically average rate of return of between 5% and 10%, you can expect to end up with some amount between $115K and $1M. However, if you wait until you're 30 to start investing, your $10K will only grow to some amount between $70K and $453K by the time you retire. That's a steep price to pay for not starting to invest ASAP!
